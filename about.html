<h1>About CarbonManager</h1>
<h2>Understanding Your Carbon Footprint</h2>

<p>CarbonManager is an interactive tool designed to help individuals understand their daily carbon footprint. It calculates the environmental impact of your transportation, electricity usage, water consumption, plastic use, and electronic waste.</p>

<p>This project is created as a **first-year Civil Engineering student project** to raise awareness about sustainability and encourage eco-friendly habits. By monitoring and improving small daily activities, each person can contribute to a healthier planet.</p>

<p>The calculator is **easy to use** and provides **personalized feedback** based on your habits, helping you make better choices to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
